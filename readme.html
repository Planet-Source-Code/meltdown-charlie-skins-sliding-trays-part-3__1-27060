<h1>Skins & Sliding Trays - part 3</h1>
This is our third installment in the quest for an implementation of skinned windows with  sliding skinned trays that move with the window...<br><br>
In this exciting episode we solve the unaccesable tray problem and also have some fun 
 changing the shapes of some standard controls...<br>
<blockquote>
All of the techniques being developed here and a whole lot more are going into our next 
 exciting product : eDermis - which is a skin design studio plus an activex dll designed 
 to simplify the implementation of the skins designed in the studio.<br>
Check us out on the web at <a href="www.intactinteractive.com">www.intactinteractive.com
</a> to find out more about this and other programs by us.
</blockquote>
As usual this is only another step in the quest so if you find any problems let us know 
 and if you would like to know more about how the skin data was created etc for this 
 sample you will find a tutorial soon in the development section of our site...<br>
You can contact me at <a href="mailto:mferris@zfree.co.nz">mferris@zfree.co.nz</a> or else
